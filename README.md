#What is SafePod?

"Formally", SafePod is a mobile app that lets your selected friends know if you haven't reached a specified place at a specified time. SafePod also provides a forum for victims to share traumatic experiences anonymously.

Remember that person who assumes the role of the caretaker when you go out partying? SafePod will bring that experience to your mobile phone! The goal of SafePod is to create an open community of developers to build technology that makes the world a safer place.

##Contact!

SafePod is an open effort that aims to build a strong community of volunteers to push the technology forward. Feel free to look at the code on Github or send us an email if you would like to get involved!
